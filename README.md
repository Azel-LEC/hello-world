# hello-world
glad to join GitHub.

Hello here, i'm Azel, just your average guy that just
started learning programming and with swift as first language, 
i joined here so i can learn as much as i can understand, 
since "i don't want to just follow footsteps but also tweak things"
to prove my understanding.
